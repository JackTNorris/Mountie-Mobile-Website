# Mountie-Mobile-Website

<h4>Description</h4>

This is the Mountie Mobile Website, designed and developed <b>solely</b> by Jack Norris. It's a little ghetto, but hey, it's not really client facing (it's for the adminstrators). With this website, you can submit events and announcements for approval from the school and have them appear on the Mountie Mobile App. It's poorly designed in messy, but I've improved immensely since making this

Using Firebase for my database and NodeJS for my backend

Note: Yes, I know that it's messy, and that I'm kind of an idiot for not using a framework and putting practically all my backend code in index.js. I didn't know a lot coming into this project, so some of the code is definitely going to be a bit messy. I'm currently working on a version that has a clean backend architecture and used Angular for the frontend
